# Percona Link for MongoDB documentation

Welcome to Percona Link for MongoDB documentation!

## Overview

Percona Link for MongoDB is a tool for replicating data from a source MongoDB cluster to a target MongoDB cluster. It supports cloning data, replicating changes, and managing collections and indexes. 

Percona Link for MongoDB requires replica set deployments of Percona Server for MongoDB and MongoDB. You must [convert your standalone instance](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/#std-label-server-replica-set-deploy-convert) to a single-node replica set to use Percona Link for MongoDB.  

Percona Link for MongoDB code is [here](https://github.com/percona/percona-link-mongodb).
