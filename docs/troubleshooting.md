# Troubleshooting guide

This guide helps you recover {{pcsm.full_name}} after an unexpected interruption, whether it occurs during initial data clone or real-time replication.

## Recover PCSM during initial data clone

{{pcsm.full_name}} can interrupt because of various reasons. For example, it is restarted, abnormally exits or loses connection to the source or destination cluster for an extended time. In any of these cases you must restart the initial data clone.

### Symptoms

After subsequently starting the service, you may see such messages:

??? example "Sample error messages"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z INF Found Recovery Data. Recovering... s=recovery
    Error: new server: recover Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB: recover: cannot resume: replication is not started or not resuming from failure
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.856Z FTL error="new server: recover Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB: recover: cannot resume: replication is not started or not resuming from failure"
    ```

### Recovery steps 

To recover PCSM, do the following:
{.power-number}

1. Stop the `pcsm` service:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ sudo systemctl stop pcsm
    ```

2. Reset the PCSM state with the following command and pass the connection string URL to the target deployment:
 
    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pcsm reset --target <target-mongodb-uri>
    ```

    The command does the following:

    * Connects to the target MongoDB deployment
    * Deletes the metadata collections 
    * Restores the `pcsm` service from the `failed` state

3. Restart `pcsm`

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ sudo systemctl start pcsm
    ```

4. Start data replication from scratch:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pcsm start
    ```

## Recover PCSM during real-time replication

PCSM can successfully complete the initial data clone and then interrupt unexpectedly, during the real-time replication. The recovery steps differ depending on how PCSM stopped.

### Unexpected shutdown

If PCSM exits abnormally or is stopped unexpectedly, restart the `pcsm` service. This is typically sufficient as PCSM resumes replication automatically from the last saved checkpoint.

??? example "Example logs"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z INF Starting Cluster Replication s=pcsm
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z DBG Change Replication is resuming s=repl
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z INF Change Replication resumed op_ts=[1748887947,1] s=repl
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.856Z DBG Checkpoint saved s=checkpointing
    ```

### Replication fails while PCSM is running

The `pcsm` process is active but the replication may fail due to a temporary connection issue or other reasons. After you resolve the reason of failure (restore the connection), follow these steps to recover PCSM:


1. Check current replication status:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pcsm status
    ```

    ??? example "Sample output"
        
        ```{.text .no-copy}
         {
           "ok": false,
           "error": "change replication: bulk write: server selection error: context deadline exceeded, current topology: { Type: ReplicaSetNoPrimary, Servers: [{ Addr: sandra-xps15:28017, Type:          Unknown, Last error: dial tcp 127.0.1.1:28017: connect: connection refused }, ] }",
           "state": "failed",
           "info": "Failed",
           "eventsProcessed": 2301,
           "lastReplicatedOpTime": "1748889570.1",
           "initialSync": {
             "lagTime": 0,
             "estimatedCloneSize": 0,
             "clonedSize": 0,
             "completed": true,
             "cloneCompleted": true
           }
         }
        ```

2. Resume the replication from the last successful checkpoint:
    
    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ pcsm resume --from-failure
    ```

3. Confirm that the replication has resumed:
   
    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    pcsm status
    ```

    ??? example "Sample output after successful resume"
  
        ```{.text .no-copy}
        {
          "ok": true,
          "state": "running",
          "info": "Replicating Changes",
          "lagTime": 140,
          "eventsProcessed": 2301,
          "lastReplicatedOpTime": "1748889570.1",
          "initialSync": {
            "lagTime": 140,
            "estimatedCloneSize": 0,
            "clonedSize": 0,
            "completed": true,
            "cloneCompleted": true
          }
        }
        ```

!!! note

    If replication still fails after using the `pcsm resume --from-failure`, even after you restored the connectivity, the target cluster availability or any other underlying issue, you'll need to start over. Refer to the [Recover PCSM during initial data clone](#recover-pcsm-during-initial-data-clone) section and reset the PCSM state to begin replication from scratch.
