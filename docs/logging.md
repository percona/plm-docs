# Logging in Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB

Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB (PCSM) provides a flexible logging system to help you monitor its operations, diagnose issues, and integrate with log management systems. You can control the log verbosity, format, and appearance using command-line flags.

## Configuration

You configure logging when the `pcsm` process starts. The following flags are available:

| Flag          | Description                                       | Default |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--log-level` | Sets the verbosity of the logs.                   | `info`  |
| `--log-json`  | Outputs logs in a structured JSON format.         | `false` |
| `--log-no-color`  | Disables colorized output for text-based logs.    | `false` |

### Environment variables

Alternatively, you can define the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PCSM_LOG_LEVEL` |Log level used for output (e.g., debug, info, warn, error). Controls the verbosity of logs. | `info` |
| `PCSM_LOG_JSON` | Output logs in JSON format. When enabled, log coloring is automatically disabled. | `false` |
| `PCSM_LOG_NO_COLOR` | Disable ANSI color codes in log output (useful for non-interactive terminals and log aggregation systems). | `false` |

### Log level

The `--log-level` flag controls the minimum level of messages that will be recorded. The supported levels are, in order of severity:

- `trace`: Highly detailed diagnostic information.
- `debug`: Detailed information useful for debugging.
- `info`: General information about the application's state and progress.
- `warn`: Potentially harmful situations or unexpected events.
- `error`: Errors that prevent a specific operation from completing but do not stop the application.
- `fatal`: Severe errors that cause the application to terminate.

**Example:** 

To see detailed debugging messages, start `pcsm` with:

```bash
pcsm --source <source-uri> --target <target-uri> --log-level=debug
```

### Log format

PCSM can output logs in two formats: human-readable text (default) and structured JSON.

#### Timestamp format

!!! admonition "Version added: 0.10.0"

PCSM writes every log timestamp in [RFC 3339 :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339){:target="_blank"} format and always in UTC, also known as Zulu time. This applies to both text and JSON output.

```{.text .no-copy}
2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z INF POST /start s=http
```

The format is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ`. The `T` separates the date from the time, and the trailing `Z` marks the timestamp as UTC, also known as Zulu time.

Using UTC provides a consistent timestamp regardless of the host's local timezone. This makes it easier to correlate PCSM logs with MongoDB logs, FTDC diagnostics, application logs, and monitoring systems without converting between local timezones.


#### Text format (default)

By default, logs are printed to the console in a color-coded, human-readable format. This is ideal for interactive use and manual inspection.

??? example "Sample output"

    ```text
    2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z INF s=http Starting HTTP server at http://localhost:2242
2026-06-02T10:43:46.955Z DBG s=repl:watch op=insert ns=test.coll1 op_ts=1780397026,1
    ```

You can disable the colorization with the `--log-no-color` flag. This is useful when redirecting log output to a file.

If you are running the PCSM server process and want to capture logs while disabling color codes, use:

```bash
pcsm --source <source-uri> --target <target-uri> --log-no-color > pcsm.log
```

For client subcommands (like start, resume, or finalize), you must redirect `stderr` to ensure the logs are actually saved:

```bash
# To capture only the logs (stderr)
pcsm start 2> pcsm.log

# To capture everything (both stdout and stderr)
pcsm start &> pcsm.log
```

#### JSON format

For automated processing and integration with log aggregation tools (like the ELK stack or Splunk), you can use the `--log-json` flag. This will output each log entry as a single line of JSON.

??? example "Sample output"

    ```json
    {"level":"info","s":"http","time":"2026-06-02T10:43:46.854Z","message":"Starting HTTP server at http://localhost:2242"}
    {"level":"debug","s":"repl:watch","op":"insert","ns":"test.coll1","op_ts":[1780397026,1],"time":"2026-06-02T10:43:46.955Z"}
    ```

### JSON field reference

When `--log-json` is enabled, the following fields may appear in the log entries:

| Field          | Type    | Description                                                                |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `level`        | string  | The severity of the log entry (e.g., info, debug).                         |
| `s`	           | string	 | The scope or component where the log originated (e.g., http, clone, repl). |
| `ns`	         | string	 | The MongoDB namespace (database.collection) related to the event.          |
| `elapsed_secs` | float	 | The time taken for an operation to complete, in seconds.                   |
| `time`	       | string  | The timestamp of the log event in RFC 3339 format, always in UTC (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ`).           |
| `message`	     | string	 | The main log message.                                                      |
| `error`	       | string	 | The error message, if an error occurred.                                   |
| `op`	         | string	 | The type of operation (e.g., insert, createIndexes).                       |
| `op_ts`	       | array	 | The MongoDB operation timestamp as [timestamp, increment].                 |
| `count`	       | integer | A count of items, such as documents in a batch.                            |
| `size_bytes`	 | integer | The size of data in bytes.                                                 |
