# Replicate from a sharded cluster to a replica set

!!! admonition "Version added: 0.10.0"

{{pcsm.full_name}} (PCSM) supports replication from a sharded MongoDB cluster to a replica set. This lets you migrate data from a sharded deployment without having to recreate the source sharding configuration on the target.

For example, you can use this topology when moving data from a sharded MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Enterprise deployment to a Percona Server for MongoDB replica set.

For information about sharded cluster support, see [Sharding support in Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB](sharding.md).

## How PCSM handles the topology difference

When the PCSM server starts, it detects that the source is sharded and the target is a replica set.

During the initial sync, {{pcsm.short}} creates collections that are sharded on the source as regular collections on the replica set target. It doesn't apply the source shard key because `shardCollection` isn't supported on replica sets.

During ongoing replication, {{pcsm.short}} skips `shardCollection` operations from the source and continues applying supported data changes to the target.

No additional configuration is required.


!!! note
    A collection that is sharded on the source is created as a regular collection on the replica set target. The collection data is copied, but the target collection isn't sharded.

## What is replicated

| **On the source** | **On the replica set target** |
|---|---|
| Sharded collection | Created as a regular collection. All documents are copied. The shard key isn't applied because it doesn't apply to a replica set. |
| Unsharded collection | Created and copied as in a replica set to replica set sync. |
| Chunk distribution and primary shard | Not preserved. PCSM replicates data, not cluster metadata. |

## Before you start

- Ensure the source and target MongoDB versions meet the [version requirements](version-compatibility.md#version-compatibility-matrix).
- Configure authentication for both deployments. Refer to [Configure authentication in MongoDB](./install/authentication.md).
- Verify that PCSM can connect to the source sharded cluster and the target replica set.

## Replication before and after cross-topology support

=== "Before cross-topology support"

    Without cross-topology handling, PCSM attempts to apply the source collection's sharding configuration to the replica set. The clone fails because the target doesn't support `shardCollection`.

    ??? example "Example"

        Follow these steps:
        {.power-number}

        1. Create two clusters, one sharded (source) and the other replica set (destination).

        2. Create two collections on the sharded cluster:

            1. `sharded_coll` (sharded)
            2. `plain_collection` (unsharded)

        3. Add documents to both the collections.

        4.  Start replication:

            ```sh
            pcsm start
            ```
        5. Check the replication status:

            ```{.text .no-copy}
            pcsm status
            {
                "ok": false,
                "error": "clone: copy: clone_shard_test_db.sharded_coll: shard collection: (CommandNotFound) no such command: 'shardCollection'",
                "state": "failed",
                "info": "Failed",
                "lagTimeSeconds": 0,
                "eventsRead": 0,
                "eventsApplied": 0,
                "initialSync": {
                    "estimatedCloneSizeBytes": 7490,
                    "clonedSizeBytes": 1490,
                    "completed": false,
                    "cloneCompleted": true
                }
            }
            Error: clone: copy: clone_shard_test_db.sharded_coll: shard collection: (CommandNotFound) no such command: 'shardCollection'
            2026-08-25T07:51:17.586Z FTL error="clone: copy: clone_shard_test_db.sharded_coll: shard collection: (CommandNotFound) no such command: 'shardCollection'"
            ```
        
        6. Check the logs:

            Output:

            ```{.text .no-copy}
            2026-08-25T07:56:21.508Z ERR Data Clone has failed: 0 B in 0s error="copy: clone_shard_test_db.sharded_coll: shard collection: shard collection: (CommandNotFound) no such command: 'shardCollection'" elapsed_secs=0.114 s=clone 
            2026-08-25T07:56:21.508Z ERR Cluster Replication has failed error="clone: copy: clone_shard_test_db.sharded_coll: shard collection: shard collection: (CommandNotFound) no such command: 'shardCollection'" s=pcsm
            ```

        7. Check the target collections. In this example, neither collection was copied to the target before the clone failed.

        Because the initial clone processes collections in parallel, the result can vary. An unsharded collection such as `plain_collection` may already be created or partially copied when cloning `sharded_coll` fails.

=== "After cross-topology support"

    With cross-topology support, PCSM detects the replica set target and skips the unsupported sharding operations.

    ??? example "Example"

        Follow these steps:
        {.power-number}

        1. Create two clusters, one sharded (source) and the other replica set (destination).

        2. Create two collections on the sharded cluster:

            1. `sharded_coll` (sharded)
            2. `plain_collection` (unsharded)

        3. Add documents to both the collections.

        4.  Start replication:

            ```sh
            pcsm start
            ```
        5. Check the replication status. `clonedSizeBytes` matches `estimatedCloneSizeBytes`, and the state is `running`:

            ```{.text .no-copy}
            pcsm status
            { 
                "ok": true, 
                "state": "running", 
                "info": "Replicating Changes", 
                "lagTimeSeconds": 0, 
                "eventsRead": 0, 
                "eventsApplied": 0, 
                "lastReplicatedOpTime": { 
                    "ts": "1787645813.1", 
                    "isoDate": "2026-08-25T08:16:53Z" 
                }, 
            "initialSync": { 
                    "estimatedCloneSizeBytes": 7490, 
                    "clonedSizeBytes": 7490, 
                    "completed": true, 
                    "cloneCompleted": true 
                } 
            }
            ```

        6. Confirm that both collections are present on the target and that document counts match:

            ```javascript
                db.sharded_coll.countDocuments()
                db.plain_collection.countDocuments()
            ```
        
            The collection that was sharded on the source appears here as a regular collection. That is expected.


        7. Finalize the sync:

            ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
            $ pcsm finalize
            ```

        8. Check the status again:

            ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
            $ pcsm status
            ```

            ```{.json .no-copy}
            {
              "ok": true,
              "state": "finalized",
              "info": "Finalized",
              "lagTimeSeconds": 1,
              "eventsRead": 0,
              "eventsApplied": 0,
              "lastReplicatedOpTime": {
                "ts": "1787645817.1",
                "isoDate": "2026-08-25T08:16:57Z"
              },
              "initialSync": {
                "estimatedCloneSizeBytes": 7490,
                "clonedSizeBytes": 7490,
                "completed": true,
                "cloneCompleted": true
              },
              "finalization": {
                "completed": true,
                "startedAt": "2026-08-25T08:16:57.539447026Z",
                "completedAt": "2026-08-25T08:16:57.539557888Z"
              }
            }
            ```

        9. Check the replication logs and confirm that no errors were recorded. For details, see [Logging in Percona ClusterSync for MongoDB](logging.md)


        10. Confirm that the documents for both `plain_collection` and `sharded_coll` got copied to the destination cluster.
