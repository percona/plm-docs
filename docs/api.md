# {{pcsm.full_name}} HTTP API documentation

## Quick start guide

To get started with {{pcsm.full_name}} API:

1. Ensure the service is running on `http://localhost:2242`
2. Use the `/start` endpoint to begin replication
3. Monitor progress using the `/status` endpoint
4. Use `/pause` and `/resume` to control the replication process
5. Call `/finalize` when replication is complete

## Authentication

Currently, the API does not require authentication. However, it's recommended to run the service behind a reverse proxy with proper authentication in production environments.

## API endpoints

### POST /start

Starts the replication process.

#### Request 

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `includeNamespaces` | string[] | No | List of namespaces to include in replication (for example, ["db.*", "db.collection"]) |
| `excludeNamespaces` | string[] | No | List of namespaces to exclude from replication |
| `replNumWorkers` | int | No | Controls how many concurrent replication worker goroutines PCSM uses to apply DML (insert/update/replace/delete) events to the target cluster.|
| `replChangeStreamBatchSize` | int | No | Sets the maximum number of change stream events PCSM will request and read from MongoDB per batch while streaming changes from the source cluster. |
| `replEventQueueSize` | int | No | Controls the size of the internal event queue used by the replication subsystem. |
| `replWorkerQueueSize` | int | No | Defines the maximum number of replication events that each replication worker thread can queue before processing.  |
| `replBulkOpsSize` | int | No | Defines the maximum number of operations that can be grouped together into a single bulk apply batch during replication. |
| `cloneSegmentSize` | string | No | Defines the byte size of each clone segment processed during the initial clone phase. Specify either a plain integer number of bytes (for example, `1048576`) or a human-readable size string accepted by the server, for example `500MB` or `1GiB`. |


Examples:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2242/start -d '{
    "includeNamespaces": ["dbName.*", "anotherDB.collName1", "anotherDB.collName2"],
    "excludeNamespaces": ["dbName.collName"],

### HA responses

The `/status`, `/start`, `/pause`, `/resume`, and `/finalize` endpoints can return the following optional HA fields when PCSM observes more than one live member:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `me.instanceId` | string | Identifier of the instance that handled the request |
| `role` | string | Role of the instance that handled the request (`ACTIVE` or `STANDBY`) |
| `group.term` | number | Current HA term |
| `group.members` | array | Live members observed by the instance |
| `group.members[].instanceId` | string | Identifier of the listed member |
| `group.members[].host` | string | Hostname of the listed member |
| `group.members[].port` | number | Port of the listed member |
| `group.members[].role` | string | Role of the listed member (`ACTIVE` or `STANDBY`) |

When one of these requests reaches a standby instance, PCSM returns HTTP `409` with `error: "not_active"` and can include the HA fields shown above:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "not_active",
  "me": {
    "instanceId": "<instance-id>"
  },
  "role": "STANDBY",
  "group": {
    "term": 7,
    "members": [
      {
        "instanceId": "<instance-id>",
        "host": "pcsm0",
        "port": 2242,
        "role": "ACTIVE"
      },
      {
        "instanceId": "<instance-id>",
        "host": "pcsm1",
        "port": 2243,
        "role": "STANDBY"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Error handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns error messages in the following format:

```json
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "Detailed error message"
}
```

Common error scenarios:

- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request parameters
- 404 Not Found: Endpoint not found
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side issues
